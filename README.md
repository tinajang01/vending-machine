# How did we build this?
Our wonderful group of 4 used **RobotC** and an **EV3** robot to bring our RoboVendor to life!!

# Challenges and Inspiration
Initially, the vending machine had a glitch where it wouldn't dispense more than one candy of the same type in a row. After some troubleshooting, we discovered that adjusting the motor encoder values solved this issue, ensuring smooth candy reorders.

Furthermore, we faced challenges with the ultrasonic sensor, which sometimes failed to register activity or remained stuck in idle mode due to the environment setting. Through perseverance and creative problem-solving, we rewrote the code from various angles until we found a reliable solution.

This journey was tough, but it taught us valuable lessons in persistence and innovation. Overcoming these hurdles inspired us to push the boundaries of what's possible, ultimately leading to a more efficient and reliable vending machine experience.
